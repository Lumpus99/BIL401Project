0,Nasa releases video of Perseverance rover landing on Mars,0
1,Perseverance rover has already found signs of mOre intelligent life on Mars than a flat earth conference.,0
2,Funny how it was already on the ground when all this was taking place....,0
3,Where is Mark Watney?,0
4,"I want to be first human to die on MarsWith my own mission, without any country, barriers, or government help.",0
5,what a great CGI,0
6,Buscando vida en Marte y aqu la gente se mueve de hambre .,0
7,Congratulations to NASA,0
8,"I was the cameraman, hope you enjoy the footage. I also do weddings if you're interested.",0
9,"Where are the Flat Marsians now???...Oh sorry, I mean the Flat Earthers???Flat Earthers ...Flat Marsians ...",0
10,These wrinkles are fascinating,0
11,Awesome,0
12,This is great accomplishment.. Congrats to NASA and their engineers.,0
13,Anyone want to start the rumour that it's been faked? That would be crazy talk,0
14,Your complaint is our main concern making us render the best of services to our clients. We are reliable and very trusted for a perfect job done.Contact the designated mail provided.,0
15,martian ants: ayooo watch yo rockets,0
16,We always talk about ufos and stuff but actually we are now aliens and the rover is a ufo for the things on mars (Im not saying there are aliens*,0
17,Absolutely mind blowing and what a privilege it is to be alive right now,0
18,Congratulations bravo NASA,0
19,oh my...,0
20,Do the rovers ever meet up? How big is mars?,0
21,Michael Bay would be proud of the Hollywood production values here.,0
22,You are FN kidding me. Welcome to the futur!,0
23,"It's impossible for humans to live on Mars. They can't even create a vehicle that will survive the ocean depths. What more of a dead planet that has no protection from outer space?While this could be an achievement, the money could have helped during the Pandemic. Is now really the time to spend billions on exploring a dead planet? The money could have been used to mitigate climate change or help people into green technologies/lifestyles.Or if they really want to have a backup plan for the destruction of Earth, put the money into experimenting with colonies that could survive the harshness of space or whatever.Such waste of money just to prove that Mars is a dead planet.",0
24,Mars has better internet speed than rural areas on Earth.,0
25,Goosebumps watching this landing,0
26,If we spend all Military budget the world are spending on space and science. Just think how far humanity are capable to go..,0
27,Anybody seen the George Bush senior video where he is wheeled into mission control and Tim Peake is on a monitor in the background in front of a blue squared CGI screen. All a rich mans trick.,0
28,Nobody can validate that st hand. So we trust these space agencies to give us the truth. But they could be paid off or under threat. This could all be CGI.,0
29,Ausgezeichnet!,0
30,"Regardless of the reality of the video.We may not need to dream of discovering another habitable planet, as all we need is to preserve this true habitable planet, ....So progress in life is not a process of acquiring new things, but a process of abandoning old mistakes.",0
31,The universe is far more complex than any mind can comprehend. Even though this is a huge step in science it's the equivalent of a baby learning to lift its head for the first time.,0
32,"This feat and footage is so so unbelievably incredible. However how much more awesome would it have been if we saw additionsl footage from other pods that landed and tumbled like curiositys landing, to then track the rover landing. Im still so exited and thrilled with perseverance landing but man that would have been incredible. How incredible as well would that have been to see that in person. A dark knight rises looking craft with rockets comes over head blasting away, and then lowers a -ton civic sized rover from tethers above. Who are the aliens now? Our technology is catching up to sci-fi with this and space x with their dragon capsule styling, and falcon boosters landing themselves in sync. What a wonderful time to be alive.",0
33,"I made in my yt channel a video of the rovers landing with no time for caution, i would be glad if you watch it thanks",0
34,F* marvelous! Now then.... any flat Marsers here?,0
35,Ack! Ack! Ack! Don't run! We are your friends!,0
36,At last the end of low res static photos.,0
37,Nasa is literally out of this world. Salute from india,0
38,But when will they land on Snickers?,0
39,So by this mission we will get some dust from Mars in !,0
40,Save spirit rover,0
41,Ok then planting somes seeds I'm m waiting to see that planting,0
42,"After the fall of earth when we are at the mars , from the mars the look likes some strarranging places",0
43,Amazing amazing.,0
44,now the other rover won't be singing happy b-day to itself anymore,0
45,"Their ""first look at the surface"" ?",0
46,the parachute going down means that the mars has also a gravitational force ?,0
47,wow amaizng great,0
48,"Die Marsianer denken jetzt auch, jetzt kommen die Deppen schon auf den marsch Angeschissen um alles zu Versauen. Aber schon komisch das so ne kleine Sonde so viel Staub aufwirbelt wie es htte bei der Mondlandung sein sollte",0
49,Truly incredible...,0
50,They better meet up with spirit,0
51,I thought that was GME going to Mars!!,0
52,Half Life?,0
53,Why those rocket engines look like they aren't ignited? :44Do they just use compressed air?,0
54,"I'm sorry..but if The Lord wanted man to go into space and love on another planet, He would have made it so much easier rather than humans trying their best through their own achievements. As far as I know...there will be a day all will end before we ever live on another planet.",0
55,"Im curious, will it find the opportunity rover?",0
56,Flat Earthers: This CGI isn't very realistic.,0
57,Earth is dying. Let go to another planet and destroy it too. Humanity is sooooo overrated. Lets feed the billions of hungry people of earth? Solve our problems here before trying to make more on another planet?,0
58,How come the wheels are smooth ?,0
59,Prove it!!!! All I see is bad technology.,0
60,"As somebody born long after the moon landing, these are pictures I will never forget",0
61,Wow... Video of the landing. This is incredible!,0
62,Can't wait to export our BS to another planet. The sooner we exploit Mars the better.,0
63,"Amazing! We destroy life on this planet, human or animal, without a whim, yet we spend millions trying to find bacterial life on another one and, at the same time, littering/contaminating the solar system with rubbish like we litter this planet. Amazing! I'm all for exploration, but can't we be a little bit more responsible about the way we go about it, and more importantly, care more for the life that is right in front of our eyes on earth. We are so irresponsible!!!!!!!",0
64,"Meanwhile in mars""(Marsians see the Rover landing)Marsians:The Gods must be crazy",0
65,In the first manned mission to Mars is accomplished. Meridian base is established by the USA (NASA/SpaceX) The mission will be named Ares1 This will happen in the next years (2024) If you dont believe me Take a Screen Shot and comeback In after they succeeded the mission this was written in,0
66,I'll be impressed when when perseverance captures a glimpse of Elon's Tesla screaming by the planet.,0
67,How fast is NASA's Internet?,0
68,Im here to herd sheep,0
69,no transformers?,0
70,Pog,0
71,I can't believe that nasa was able to get complete clear footage of landing.hats off nasa,0
72,I hope people dont really believe any of this is real. They can get to Mars but they just cant figure out how to get back to the moon. Total BS!,0
73,Wow that's so cool,0
74,The nerd celebration at the end,0
75,Seconds later a giant worm eats rover,0
76,Waiting for confused Travolta memes,0
77,What a huge success!!!!,0
78,"Great news. But I wish there wasn't anyone on Earth suffering from hunger, malnutrition and of lack of education..We need to sort out our priorities.",0
79,Gives me goosebumps just thinking how far this is from us.,0
80,And Robot Planet Mars gets it's latest Citizen,0
81,rest is up to elon musk,0
82,It feels so surreal to be able to see so clearly the surface of another planet. I hope i can live long enough to see maybe the first man on Mars!,0
83,Millions of dollars just to see dust and rock,0
84,"Interesting dust cloud, just before touchdown. Did Apolo have this on the moon",0
85,"Wow, awe-inspiring. Simply impressive.",0
86,amazing ..understated and historic video from another planet,0
87,Broadsword Calling Danny Boy,0
88,Just simply incredible!!!,0
89,Just the idea of being able to send and receive video files million miles away is an achievement in itself!,0
90,Where is flat mars society?,0
91,"Brother Curie Im home, Persie",0
92,Amazing,0
93,"Wow, this is so cool!",0
94,When human finally manage to settle a colonies there I hope some of the city are named after all of these rovers,0
95,Mars is flat,0
